##About me
Hi. I'm Thibault Vigouroux. I'm a software engineer who work and live in Paris. I value light-weight agile processes, TDD, and good design. I enjoy building simple apps that people love using. I'm passionate about productivity and software development, and so that's what I'm going to write about and I hope you will enjoy it.
