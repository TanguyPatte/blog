title: I tried colemak for one month

Touch typing … certainly the most important skill to master for a computer science guy. « If your work requires using any sort of computer, learning how to touch-type is the single most significant thing you can do to improve your productivity » Josh Kaufman in [The First 20 Hours: How to Learn Anything . . . Fast!](http://www.amazon.com/The-First-20-Hours-Anything/dp/1591845556) That’s what really motivated me to learn to type faster. To do so I decided to use the Colemak layout.


# What is Colemak ?

Colemak in a keyboard layout invented in 2006 by Shai Coleman. It’s an alternative for QWERTY and DVORAK, and it’s the third most popular layout and it looks like this :

# Why change ?

First of all it’s a much more ergonomic layout than QWERTY because it lets your fingers stay in the home row most of the time since the most common letters are on it. Moreover it is easier to learn as compare to DVORAK because not all the letters change. For instance, x,c and v stay preserving the C-x, C-c and C-v shortcut. It’s fast because most of the time you alternate from right to left hand which allows you to gain speed, and of course your fingers travel less. I especially decided to stop using QWERTY because I was feeling guilt. Yes guilt ! Because I knew that all day long I was using a layout that was far from being efficient. Knowing that I would probably type most of the time during my day for the next 50 years. I couldn’t continue like this. In order to choose my new layout I used this website that allows to compare the efficiency of different layouts given an input text. Hence I pasted some of my personal code, long emails and my bash_history. And Colemak was always on top ! I really encourage you to do the same in order to find the layout that fits you.

# The Method and tools I used

Now is the time, I am in front of my computer and I just changed the keyboard layout from QWERTY to Colemak. Now what ?

## Memorize the layout with Keyzen (2 days, 2h per day)

I think this is the most important phase since it allows you, once the layout is memorized, to not use any external material to check the place of the letters. You just need to think. In order to do that I used [this](http://patorjk.com/keyboard-layout-analyzer/#/main) website. It took me to day to put the layout in my brain.

## Start getting faster with gtypist (2 weeks, 1-2h per day)

Now that the layout is in the head, it is time to start getting faster by improving the muscle memory. For that gtypist is great because it uses real words that only contains letters of the current lesson and the previous one. For instance the first lesson uses words that only contain s,t,n,e, and the second lesson uses words that contain only s,t,n,e and r,i. I allowed myself to go to the next level only if I could type the current lesson with less that 3% of errors. The first week I tried to go through every lessons at a speed of 40w/min and the second week at 60w/min.

## Master the home row (1 week)

From this moment it didn’t feel any more frustrations since I was almost as efficient as with the QWERTY layout. But my purpose was to be faster that with QWERTY so I kept going with the chrome plugin [TypeFu](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/type-fu/pofoighmmpljaikjiidkkfhldjndfdbk?hl=en). I used the plugin for one week, the purpose was to be very efficient using only the keyboard line of the home row, because those letters are the one that I’ll use the most, and so I only used the first lesson. I set the conditions to reach the level 2 to more than 60w/min with less than 1% of errors.

## Next step : use Amphetype

This is where I am as I am writing this article. My next goal consists of mastering the most use bi-grams and tri-grams using Amphetype. This software allows you to use your own input text and to get really precise results (WPM, accuracy, and viscosity (as the opposite of fluidity) statistics on texts, words, keys, and trigrams).

# Results

As I was training, every day I have raced at typeracer in order to check that I was typing faster. Here is the result of 25 days of Colemak using the method I have describe above :

Before I start using Colemak I was typing at a speed of 60w/min. I made 5 races per day starting the first day I trained. Thus this chart represents my speed during those last 25 days.

# Mistake

Prefer accuracy over speed because otherwise you’ll make the same mistake over and over again. And once your very accurate do your best to increase your speed. That was my mistake.

# Regret

I have only one regret, I have almost completely forgotten QWERTY, I really need to look at the touch in order to type correctly in QWERTY. And this get painful when I have to type on a computer that is not mine. Thus I need to find a way to change the layout really fast on any OS.

# Conclusion

It was really worth the two weeks of frustration. The feeling of guilt has now disappeared. I am know using a layout that is optimized, thus diminish the risk of injuries and will probably allow me to type faster than ever. If you still type in QWERTY I highly encourages you to change, it will take 2 weeks of work, but after that you’ll regret to not have make that change sooner.
