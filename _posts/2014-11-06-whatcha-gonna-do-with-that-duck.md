[Whatcha Gonna Do with That Duck?](http://www.amazon.com/Whatcha-Gonna-That-Duck-Provocations/dp/1591846099) is a book written by Seth Godin a famous marketer who have worked at Yahoo and have written a lot of books on the subject. It's a 600 pages book filled with blog posts he wrote from 2006 to 2012. There was so many interesting ideas in it that summarizing it in one article is impossible. That's why I'll just share my top 10.

## 1 - It's doing nothing that kills you

When you do nothing ... nothing happens. Nothing new here. The only thing that strikes me is that too often we fear the failure and thus we do nothing. In multiple part of the book Seth emphatizes that we must have the guts to fail more often. It takes sometime only one success to build a amazing carrer.

## 2 - The new challenge in our jobs is to do either hard/risky intellectual work or emotional labour

In the past, working was hard, you had to sweat all day long working in the fields. Nowadays, we spend most of our time behind a desk. It's not hard. The challenge now is to take considerate risks, intellectual one and emotional one. Having the conversation with your colleague or your boss you fear to have, trying this new idea you have in mind for months ... You have to sweat !

## 3 - In and out

Every day we read articles and books, we assist conferences and we learn new things. That's nice. But how many of those things goes out ? Why not share what you have learned, what you have read ? You can give a speach or start a blog. Doing it will help you retain better what you've learned and give you audience.

## 4 - You need a permission to sell stuffs

It's called Permission Marketing and it's the opposite of Interruption Marketing. Send a mail to someone only if you're completely sure that he will be interested by it's content. 

## 5 - You learn a business book by implementing 3 things

Every time you start reading a business book keep in mind that at the end of it you must implement 3 things in your day to day life that you've learned in that book.

## 6 - The T-shirt rule

It's to check whether you've created a remarkable experience. "Would I buy the T-Shirt ?". Test it with your blog, your company ...

## 7 - The long trail

The long trail is the fact of building things that will last a long time. The Rollings Stones, the Eagles, Elton John have made more that 50 million dollars last year, that's the long trail.

## 8 - Do remarkable things
`
I don't know why but the "remarkable" really strikes me. In my day to day life do I make remarkable things ? Do I live a remarkable life ? If not, what can I change about this ?

## 9 - Make big promises and overdeliver

This is marketing. Making big promises allows you to not be boring. Overdeliver allows the word of mouth.

## 10 - Reach the no résumé state

When you apply for a job you shouldn't need a resume. Having some extraordinary letter of recommandation for serious persons or having build a previous amazing product or being notorious through your blog should be enough. Easier said that done of course ...

# The 3 things I'll try do implement in my day to day life

* Implement 3 things at the end of every business book I read
* Make something intellectually risky or emotionnally difficult every day
* Try to fail more !
